# Abstract

A class marked as abstract is designed to be extended upon and cannot be
instantiated. Once one property is declared abstract, the entire class
becomes abstract as well. An abstract method only needs to define a signature
and should not include any functionality.

```javascript
var Base = Class({ abstract: true }, {
    'abstract public login(string, string)' : function (user, pass) {}
});

// Throws an error: An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
new Base();

var Child = Class({ extends: Base }, { /* ... */ });

// Throws an error: Missing abstract member implementation of "login".
new Child();



var Child = Class({ extends: Base }, {
    'public login(string)' : function (user) {
        // Do stuff ...
    }
});

// Also throws an error: Missing abstract member implementation of "login", since the function signature doesn't match.
new Child();



// ...
var Child = Class({ extends: Base }, {
    'public login(string, string)' : function (user, pass) {
        // Do stuff ...
    }
});

// OK.
new Child();
```
