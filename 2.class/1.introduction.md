# Introduction

A class is defined using the function `Class` to which an object is passed
that contains the body. The body of a class is created using native 
[JavaScript object notation](http://www.json.org/).

A class may contain its own properties and functions (called methods) between
the curly braces.

### Example #1: Simple Class definition
```javascript
var SimpleClass = Class({
    
    // property declaration
    val : 'a default value',
    
    // method declaration
    displayVal : function() {
        console.log(this.val);
    }
});
```

The psuedo-variable `this` is a reference to the object context of an 
instantiated class, allowing you to access its members (properties and
methods).

The native JavaScript equivalent of the first example looks like this:

```javascript
var SimpleClass = function() {
    // property declaration
    this.val = 'a default value';
}

// method declaration
SimpleClass.prototype.displayVal = function() {
    console.log(this.val);
}
```

The disadvantage of prototype-based classes is that it's easy to lose track of
available properties and methods. This is mainly because members of the class 
are declared outside the 'scope' of the class body.

## Creating objects

A common mistake in JavaScript is when functions designed to be classes are
executed like functions. The reason for this is that both types are declared
using the `function` keyword.

A class written using JOII can only be 
[instantiated](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/instantiation) using
the `new` keyword.

### Example #2: Instantiating a class

```javascript
// Create an object based on the class 'SimpleClass'.
var my_class = new SimpleClass();

// Write the value of 'this.val' to the console.
my_class.displayVal();
```

## Constructor

I some cases, it's required to execute some code when a class is being 
instantiated. This is done using a *constructor*. In Java, the constructor is
a method inside the class body that has the same name as the class itself.
Unfortunately, this isn't possible in JavaScript. To tackle this issue, we use
a method called `__construct` (similar to PHP).

### Example #3: Using a constructor

```javascript
var MyClass = Class({
    val: 'a default value',
    
    __construct : function(value) {
        // Assign the given 'value' to the 'val' property.
        this.val = value;
    },
    
    displayVal : function() {
        console.log(this.val);
    }
});

// Create an object based on MyClass and pass it a string argument.
var my_class = new MyClass('A custom value!');

// Print "A custom value!" to the console.
my_class.displayVal();

// Create another object
var second_class = new MyClass('Another value!');

// Print "Another value!" to the console.
second_class.displayVal();
```
